# Image-Similarity-Search-Engine
- This project demonstrates how to build an image search engine using Sentence Transformers and FAISS. We leverage the power of pre-trained CLIP models to generate embeddings for images, and then use FAISS to efficiently index and search these embeddings.
## Acknowledgments
